If you say say any word starting with any letter and followed by "ing", it'll reply with the a word starting with the same letter but ending in "ong". ie., "ping" -> "pong".

How to install
==============

It runs on Node JS v6.11.1 for Windows (Discord.js requires higher but I ran on v6.11.1 so newer versions may be buggy),
and Discord.js version 11.1.0. This program requires a file with the bot's client token to be in the same directory as this
file, with the name "client token.txt".
